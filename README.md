`man scrbl`

I'm glad you asked.

New version of Scrabble but with the dictionary words replaced with unix commands.

Oh and you can use space as a tile and you get punctuation like ~ * ! etc...

PLUS

You can pipe one word into another with |. Still figuring out how that is going to work.

An example board:

+-+-+-+-+-+-+
| | | | | | |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|h|t|o|p| | |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|o| | | | | |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|s| | | | | |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|t| | | | | |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|n| | | | | |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|a| | | | | |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|m| | | | | |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|e| | | | | |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+
